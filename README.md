# FacilityManagement
Facility Management Case Studies with Machine Learning and AI
**Overview**
This repository contains Python code for various use cases in facility management, specifically in the real estate domain. The project demonstrates how Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be leveraged to enhance different aspects of facility management, including 	Workplace Experience, 	Vendor Management, Maintenance and Repairs, 	Space Utilization, Energy Management, Energy Management and Integrated Facility Management.

**Summary**
Optimize the performance and value of real estate assets by providing innovative and sustainable facility management solutions that ensure safety, comfort, and productivity for all occupants..

**UseCases:**

**Optimizing Vendor Selection and Performance Monitoring:**        
        Optimizing vendor selection and performance monitoring involves using machine learning models to analyze vendor performance data and identify the best suppliers. Predictive analytics can forecast future performance based on historical data, helping facilities choose vendors that offer the best value and reliability. This approach reduces the risk of vendor-related issues, improves service quality, and enhances cost efficiency. By continuously monitoring vendor performance, facilities can ensure that they maintain high standards and quickly address any issues that arise. This proactive approach helps in maintaining strong vendor relationships and ensures consistent service delivery

**Automated Contract Management:** 
        Automated contract management uses natural language processing (NLP) and contract analytics to streamline the management of vendor contracts. This includes automating the review, approval, and monitoring of contracts to ensure compliance and performance standards are met. By reducing manual effort and improving accuracy, this approach enhances productivity and reduces the risk of contract-related disputes. Automated contract management also provides better visibility into contract terms and obligations, helping facilities make informed decisions and maintain strong vendor relationships. This leads to more efficient contract negotiations and better compliance tracking..

**Predictive Maintenance for Equipment:** 
      Predictive maintenance uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data from sensors on equipment to predict when maintenance should be performed. This prevents unexpected failures and extends the lifespan of assets. Anomaly detection models identify deviations from normal operating conditions, signaling the need for maintenance before a breakdown occurs. This proactive approach minimizes downtime and maintenance costs, ensuring that equipment operates efficiently and reliably. By scheduling maintenance based on actual equipment condition rather than a fixed schedule, facilities can optimize their maintenance resources and reduce unnecessary expenses.
